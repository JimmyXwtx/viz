- ### [A Survey of Scholarly Data Visualization](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8314667)
  - 2018
  - Abstract:
Scholarly information usually contains millions of raw data, such as authors, papers, citations, as well as scholarly networks. With the rapid growth of the digital publishing and harvesting, how to visually present the data efficiently becomes challenging. Nowadays, various visualization techniques can be easily applied on scholarly data visualization and visual analysis, which enables scientists to have a better way to represent the structure of scholarly data sets and reveal hidden patterns in the data. In this paper, we first introduce the basic concepts and the collection of scholarly data. Then, we provide a comprehensive overview of related data visualization tools, existing techniques, as well as systems for the analyzing volumes of diverse scholarly data. Finally, open issues are discussed to pursue new solutions for abundant and complicated scholarly data visualization, as well as techniques, that support a multitude of facets.

  - Abstract:
This paver attempts to explain the mechanics of writing a survey paper in data visualization or visual analytics. It serves asa useful starting point for those who have never written a survey paper or have very litle experience. A literature review orsurvey paper is ofen considered the starting point of a PhD candidate's scientific degree. However, there are no dedicatedpapers that focus on guidelines for the planning or writing of a survey paer or literature review in visualization or visua.analvtics. We provide guidelines and our recommendations for a foundational structure on which to build a survey paverwhilst also considering intermediate goals, and offer helpful advice to improve the survey process and literature analvysis. Theresult is a useful starting point for those wishing to write a survey paper or state-of-the-art (STAR) review in visualization oivisual analvtics. The guidelines and recommendations we make can also be generalized to other areas of computing and science
An abstract is a required feature of a survey paper and should identity the topic of the literature review. A good abstractaddresses why the given topic is interesting and why it is helpful. A good abstract features the following elements: (1) topicintroduction, (2) the motivation, (3) the goal of the review, and the benefits the review provides to the reader.

- [Does visualization matter? the role of interactive data visualization to make sense of information](https://research.monash.edu/en/publications/does-visualization-matter-the-role-of-interactive-data-visualizat)
   - 2018
   - Abstract
As part of business analytics (BA) technologies, reporting and visualization play essential roles in mitigating users’ limitations (i.e., being inexperienced, having limited knowledge, and relying on simplified information). Reporting and visualization can potentially enhance users’ sense-making, thus permitting them to focus more on the information’s message rather than numerical analysis. To better understand the role of reporting and visualization in a contextualized environment, we investigate using interactive data visualization (IDV) within accounting. We aim to understand whether IDV can help enhance non-professional investors’ ability to make sense of foundational financial statement analyses. This study conducted an experiment using a sample of 324 nonprofessional investors. Our findings indicate that nonprofessional investors who use IDV are more heuristically adept than non-professional investors who use non-IDV. These findings enrich the theoretical understanding of business analytics’ use in accounting decision making. The results of this study also suggest several practical courses of action, such as promoting wider use of IDV and making affordable IDV more broadly available, particularly for non-professional investors.

- [What is Interaction for Data Visualization?](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8805424)
  - 2019
  - Abstract:
Interaction is fundamental to data visualization, but what “interaction” means in the context of visualization is ambiguous and confusing. We argue that this confusion is due to a lack of consensual definition. To tackle this problem, we start by synthesizing an inclusive view of interaction in the visualization community - including insights from information visualization, visual analytics and scientific visualization, as well as the input of both senior and junior visualization researchers. Once this view takes shape, we look at how interaction is defined in the field of human-computer interaction (HCI). By extracting commonalities and differences between the views of interaction in visualization and in HCI, we synthesize a definition of interaction for visualization. Our definition is meant to be a thinking tool and inspire novel and bolder interaction design practices. We hope that by better understanding what interaction in visualization is and what it can be, we will enrich the quality of interaction in visualization systems and empower those who use them.

- [Choosing effective colours for data visualization](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/568118)
   - 1996
   - Abstract:
We describe a technique for choosing multiple colours for use during data visualization. Our goal is a systematic method for maximizing the total number of colours available for use, while still allowing an observer to rapidly and accurately search a display for any one of the given colours. Previous research suggests that we need to consider three separate effects during colour selection: colour distance, linear separation, and colour category. We describe a simple method for measuring and controlling all of these effects. Our method was tested by performing a set of target identification studies; we analysed the ability of thirty eight observers to find a colour target in displays that contained differently coloured background elements. Results showed our method can be used to select a group of colours that will provide good differentiation between data elements during data visualization.
